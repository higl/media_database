General:
- go to python 3

Appearance:
- make windows scalable
- dropdown menues for attributes in InfoWindow / InfoFrame / SelectorFrame
- use human units for length strings

Functionality:
- add functionality to add attributes into InfoWindow
- reduce number of falls positives in video comparison (current problems: very small number of points in some frames -> reduce averaging time/ relax criteria
                                                                          logos in corner should be detected and ignored (detection might also be useful for grouping entries) ) 
- threading where it is necessary (mainly io stuff)  
- the save button is kind of useless - reuse it for a update function
- Comfort functions to:
    - edit typos / find typos (use a 'closest string' approach)
    - rename attributes
- no length attribute for `.mov` and `.flv`
- Image viewer -> use the styles
- Video player
- read meta data and use as attributes
- fast load function that does not touch files. 
- there should be a way to search for non set entries 
- add multi threadding to comparison + use a more clustered approach that reduces memory consumption (e.g. each worker thread analyses a 20x20 matrix where the comparison files are loaded only at the start of the worker thread) 
- Unify the handling of paths, some functions in media_database expect full paths, while others handle the entries based on the stored paths, which does not contain the parent directory
- Allow for several folders to be handled by the same database (<- tricky with the current implementation of paths in db)
 
Style:
- comments
- define and implement naming convention
- use @property decorators where it is appropriate

DONE:
- fix entry length (= make layout constant)
- scrollbars
- implement some advanced search functions like AND and OR
