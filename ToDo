- make windows scalable
- fix entry length (= make layout constant)
- scrollbars
- threading for all database functions (queueing + find out how many threads a system likes)
- comments
- dropdown menues for attributes in InfoWindow / InfoFrame / SelectorFrame
- define and implement naming convention
- put all possible attributes in a list of the database (+ count how many elements support that attribute) -> communication between database and entries needed in case of changes to an entry
- implement some advanced search functions like AND and OR
- clean up input string in load entry ... remove leading /n and ending spaces 

Future improvements:
- Image viewer 
- Video player
